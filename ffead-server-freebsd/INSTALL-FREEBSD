BSD based Installation

1. Refer INSTALL-WINDOWS-CYGWIN file for directions on how to install on Windows and Cygwin
2. Download the tar file and extract it to the location of your choice.
3. Make sure boost >=v1.4 libraries and boost devel packages are installed on your system(install from ports or use pkg_add)
4. Install Unix-ODBC and required odbc files for MySQL dependency alongwith development files
5. Install Open-SSL and development files
5. JSON-SPIRIT source and header files are already included in the source code distribution
5. Also included prototype.js in source for AJAX support
6. Go to the ffead-server-freebsd/Release or ffead-server-freebsd/Debug depending on whether you need to debug the server code
7. Open terminal and type gmake all
8. This will create the distribution folder named ffead-server-freebsd inside ffead-server-freebsd/Release or ffead-server-freebsd/Debug folders accordingly
9. Place your application shared library inside the ffead-server-freebsd/Release/ffead-server/lib or ffead-server-freebsd/Debug/ffead-server/lib folder.
10. Place your web application specific files inside the ffead-server-freebsd/Release/ffead-server/web folder inside a folder with your application name
11. Type ./server.sh when inside the ffead-server-freebsd folder to start the application server
12. A default application is already provided for your reference inside the ffead-server-freebsd/web folder
13. To compile the default application shared library go to the ffead-server-freebsd/Release/ffead-server/web/default/src/Debug folder and run "gmake all"
14. Copy the libdefault library to the ffead-server-freebsd/Release/ffead-server/lib folder
15. Remember all installation files(makefile,subdir.mk) assume the ports are installed to the /usr/local/lib directory, in case you choose custom settings during 
    installation of dependencies then make sure to change all files to include the -L/usr/local/lib to -L/location/of your/choice
