Installation On Windows with Cygwin

1. Download Cygwin setup.exe and follow instruction to install Cygwin, proceed with default settings.
2. After Cygwin is successfully installed, you can open a cygwin terminal to check whether Cygwin works.
3. Run the setup.exe to install further dependencies whenever required.
4. Following are the dependencies,
      gcc
      g++
      autoconf
      automake
      openssl libraries and devel (use Cygwin_SSL_UnixOdbc_libs.zip from downloads section for version 1.0)
      unixODBC libraries and devel (not found in Cygwin reposistory, use Cygwin_SSL_UnixOdbc_libs.zip from download section)
      bison,yacc,flex,gdb,readline,binutils (for building and installing openssl and unixODBC)
5. Using Cygwin v1.7.14-2 and unixODBC v2.3.1.tar.gz, the install (./configure,make,make install) worked, you can copy the /usr/local/lib/libodbc* files to /usr/lib if you are
	confident enough of trying a manual install of unixodbc. Trying to build on prior versions of cygwin and unixodbc, i faced certain issues and wasn't able to successfully compile
	and build files, hence had provided the *_libs.zip file.
6. Copy bin/gcc-3 or bin/gcc-4 and rename it ot gcc (the already existing link file gcc sometimes gives permission errors)
7. You can build and install openssl and unixodbc and copy the required library files to the cygwin lib folder. The already built libraries are present in the Cygwin_SSL_UnixOdbc_libs.zip file which can be copied to the lib folder directly.
8. Download the latest release tar file and extract it to the location of your choice under Cygwin installation.
9. Install Unix-ODBC and required odbc files for MySQL dependency and development files
10. Install Open-SSL as well and development files
11. Also included prototype.js in source for AJAX support
12. Go to the ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Release or ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Debug depending on whether you need to debug the server code
13. Open terminal and type make all
14. This will create the distribution folder named ffead-server-winx-cygwin inside ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Release or ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Debug folders accordingly
15. Place your application shared library inside the ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Release/ffead-server or ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Debug/ffead-server folder.
16. Place your web application specific files inside the ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Release/ffead-server/web folder inside a folder with your application name
17. Type ./server.sh when inside the ffead-server-winx-cygwin folder to start the application server
18. A default application is already provided for your reference inside the ffead-server-winx-cygwin/web folder
19. To compile the default application shared library go to the ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Release/ffead-server/web/default/src/Debug folder and run "make all"
20. Copy the libdefault library to the ffead-server-winx-cygwin/Release/ffead-server/lib folder
