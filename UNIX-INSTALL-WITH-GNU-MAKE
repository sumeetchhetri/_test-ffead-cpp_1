GNU/Linux based Installation

1. Refer INSTALL-WINDOWS-CYGWIN file for directions on how to install on Windows and Cygwin
2. Download the tar file and extract it to the location of your choice.
3. Install Unix-ODBC and required odbc files for MySQL dependency alongwith development files
4. Install Open-SSL and development files
5. Also included prototype.js in source for AJAX support
6. Go to the ffead-server/Release or ffead-server/Debug depending on whether you need to debug the server code
7. Open terminal and type "make all" and "make build-apps" to build the server and the default applications provided ("make all" will build ffead with all modules enabled)
8. From version 1.8 onwards you can also select modules to build within ffead using the make modules={comma separated module list} all command, for a complete list of modules names please refer Modules, for e.g, to only build modules webservice,binserialize and distocache use the command "make modules=webservice,binserialize,distocache all"
9. This will create the distribution folder named ffead-server inside ffead-server/Release or ffead-server/Debug folders accordingly
10. Type ./server.sh when inside the ffead-server folder to start the application server
11. Some sample default applications are already provided for your reference inside the ffead-server/web folder, the default application is served at urlpath /, the flexApp application at /flexApp and the oauthApp at /oauthApp
12. If you did not already perform "make build-apps", then to compile a given web application shared library go to the ffead-server/web/{default/flexApp/oauthApp/(your_custom_app)}/src/Debug folder and run "make all"
13. Place the generated application shared library inside the ffead-server/Release/ffead-server/lib or ffead-server/Debug/ffead-server/lib folder.
14. Place your custom web applications inside the ffead-server/Release/ffead-server/web folder (Note the application folder name will also be the URL path - application name)
